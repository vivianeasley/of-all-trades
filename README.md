# Of All Trades
Of all trades is a game made for the JSK13 competition and is about information sharing in the 13th century. Today we don't think about how easy and ubiquitous skill sharing is due books, internet, etc. The game's goal was to focus on how difficult it would have been to find an apprentice under trade masters at the time.

# Instructions
Click on the isometric image to move around. When your character is over the next tradesperson in your apprenticeship list you automatically learn that skill. Some skills let you traverse different terrains. When you complete the entire list and meet the lord of the lands you win the game. There are 25 fiefdoms in a grid and each fiefdom is 200 x 200 blocks. Trades people will be out wandering the countryside but generally you will find them in settlements (homesteads, farms, villages, towns, and the main city).
